# Paytm Landing Page Clone

<h3>Paytm Landing Page Clone</h3>
This project is a clone of the Paytm landing page, created solely using HTML and CSS. It serves as a hands-on exercise to deepen understanding of these foundational web development technologies. However, it's essential to note that this clone is not responsive, meaning it does not adapt well to different screen sizes and devices.

Technologies Used
HTML: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML.
VsCode: Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Features
HTML Structure: The HTML structure mimics the layout of the Paytm landing page, including header, navigation bar, sections for various services, and footer.
CSS Styling: CSS is used extensively to style the HTML elements, replicating the visual appearance of the original Paytm page.
Responsive Design: While the project lacks responsiveness, it's a crucial aspect to consider in modern web development. Responsive design ensures that websites display correctly on various devices and screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience.
Why This Project?
